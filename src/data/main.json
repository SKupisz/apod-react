Based on advice by astronomer <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosigenes_of_Alexandria'>Sosigenes of Alexandria</a>, the Julian calendar included one <a href='http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/LeapYear.html'>leap day</a> every four years to account for the fact that an Earth year is slightly more than 365 days long.  In modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun once is 365.24219 mean solar days.  So if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift from the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and eventually July (named for <a href= 'http://www.literaturepage.com/read/shakespeare_juliuscaesar.html'>Julius Caesar</a> himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter.  By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years,  the Julian calendar year would drift much less.  In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days  should not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400.  This <a href='http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html'>Gregorian Calendar</a> system is the one in wide use today.  <a href='ap171007.html'>Of course, tidal friction</a> in the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually lengthens the day by about 14 milliseconds per century.

Taken 3 minutes apart, they almost melt together in a continuous screen that captures the dark colors within the shadow itself and the northern curve of the shadow's edge.

The blue eclipsed moonlight originates as rays of sunlight pass through layers high in Earth's upper stratosphere, colored by ozone that scatters red light and transmits blue.

In a desert, there should be relatively few obscuring clouds and trees.

A <a href='ap170301.html'>ring-of-fire eclipse</a> is an annular eclipse that occurs when <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/'>the Moon</a> is far enough away on its elliptical orbit around <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/'>the Earth</a> so that it appears too small, angularly, to cover <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/' >the entire Sun</a>. At the maximum of an <a href='https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question6.html' >annular eclipse</a>, the edges of the Sun can be seen all around the edges of the Moon, so that the Moon appears to be a dark spot that covers most -- but not all -- of the Sun. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_December_26,_2019' >This particular eclipse</a>, they knew, would peak <a href='ap191227.html'>soon after sunrise</a>.

After development, building, testing, and launch,  <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/science/nasa-titan-dragonfly-caesar.html' >Dragonfly</a> is currently scheduled to reach Titan in 2034.  The  <a href='http://dragonfly.jhuapl.edu/Gallery/' >featured animated video</a> envisions Dragonfly arriving at Titan,  beginning its airborne exploration,  <a href='ap130121.html'>landing</a> to establishing a radio link back to Earth, and then continuing on to another trans-Titanian flight.  It is hoped that  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn3-0a19sC8' >Dragonfly</a> will not only help humanity better understanding Titan's weather, chemistry, and  <a href='ap160307.html'>changing landscape</a>, but also bolster humanity's understanding of  <a href='https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/big-questions/how-did-life-begin-and-evolve-earth-and-has-it-evolved-elsewhere-solar-system' >how life first developed</a> on our young Earth.
