In modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun once is 365.24219 mean solar days.  So if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift from the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and eventually July (named for <a href= 'http://www.literaturepage.com/read/shakespeare_juliuscaesar.html'>Julius Caesar</a> himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter.  By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years,  the Julian calendar year would drift much less.  In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days  should not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400.  This <a href='http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html'>Gregorian Calendar</a> system is the one in wide use today.  <a href='ap171007.html'>Of course, tidal friction</a> in the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually lengthens the day by about 14 milliseconds per century.

Lynds' Dark Nebula (<a href='http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/W3Browse/ nebula-catalog/ldn.html'>LDN</a>) 1622 appears against a faint background of glowing hydrogen gas only visible in long telescopic exposures of the region. In contrast, the brighter reflection nebula <a href='https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/VdB_62'>vdB 62</a> is more easily seen, just above and right of center. LDN 1622 lies near the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy, close <a href='ap101023.html'>on the sky</a> to <a href='http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/ngc/b-loop.html'>Barnard's Loop</a>, a large cloud surrounding the rich <a href='ap070125.html'>complex of emission nebulae</a> found in the Belt and Sword <a href='http://www.gb.nrao.edu/~rmaddale/Education/OrionTourCenter/ optical.html'>of Orion</a>. With swept-back outlines, the obscuring dust of LDN 1622 is thought to lie at a similar distance, perhaps 1,500 light-years away.

It was made <a href='ap190627.html'>with solargraph</a> images from an ingenious array of 27 pinhole cameras. The first frame from the <a href='https://petapixel.com/2019/07/17/this-is-the-worlds-first-solargraphy-timelapse/'>Solarcan camera matrix</a> was recorded near December 21, 2018. The last frame in the series finished near June 21, 2019, the northern summer solstice. All 27 camera exposures were started at the same time, with a camera covered and removed from the array once a week. Viewed consecutively the pinhole camera pictures accumulate the traces of the Sun's daily path from winter (bottom) to summer (top) solstice. Traces of the Sun's path are reflected by the foreground Williestruther Loch, in the Scottish Borders.

Blue stars are hot and red stars are cool so that astronomical color index ranging from bluer to redder follows the relative stellar temperature scale from left (hot) to right (cool).  In M13's HR diagram, the stars clearly fall into distinct groups.  The broad swath extending diagonally from the bottom right is the cluster's main sequence.  A sharp turn toward the upper right hand corner follows the red giant branch while the blue giants are found grouped in the upper left.

Over time higher mass stars have evolved off the main sequence into red, then blue giants <a href='ap140530.html'>and beyond</a>.

About 30 Quadrantid meteors can be counted in this skyscape composed of digital frames recorded in dark and moonless skies between 2:30am and local dawn.  The shower's radiant is rising just to the right of the Canary Island of Tenerife's Teide volcano, and just below the familiar stars of the Big Dipper on the northern sky.  A likely source of the dust stream that produces Quadrantid meteors was identified <a href='http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/leonidnews47.html'>in 2003 as an asteroid</a>.  Look carefully and you can also spot a small, telltale greenish coma above the volcanic peak and near the top of the frame.

Yesterday NASA's robotic spacecraft  <a href='https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/mission/overview/'>InSight</a>  made a dramatic landing on  <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/mars/overview/'>Mars</a> after a  <a href='https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/21905/insights-route-to-mars/' >six-month trek</a> across the inner Solar System.  <a href='https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7290' >Needing to brake</a> from 20,000 km per hour to zero in about  <a href='ap120731.html'>seven minutes</a>, Insight decelerated by as much as 8  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force'> g's</a>  and heated up to 1500 degrees  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius'>Celsius</a>  as it deployed a heat shield,  a parachute, and at the end, rockets.   The  <a href='https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA22829'>featured image</a>  was the  <a href='https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22159/insights-first-image-from-mars/?site=insight' >first taken</a> by InSight on Mars, and welcome proof that the spacecraft had shed enough speed to  <a href='https://youtu.be/kyD0q57zw40'>land softly</a>  and function on the red planet.  During its final descent, InSight's rockets  <a href='ap180623.html'>kicked up dust</a>  which can be seen stuck to the lens cap of the  <a href='https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/about-the-lander/#cameras' >Instrument Context Camera</a>.  Past the spotty dirt, parts of  <a href='https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/about-the-lander/' >the lander</a> that are visible include  cover bolts at the bottom and a lander footpad on the lower right.  Small rocks are  <a href='https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/22159/insights-first-image-from-mars/?site=insight'>visible across</a> the rusty red soil,  while the arc across the top of the image is the  <a href='ap150512.html'>Martian horizon</a> dividing land and sky.  Over the next few weeks <a href='https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/'>InSight</a> will deploy several scientific instruments, including a  <a href='https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/spacecraft/instruments/seis/' >rumble-detecting seismometer</a>.   These instruments are expected to give humanity unprecedented data involving the  <a href='http://science.sciencemag.org/content/308/5725/1120' >interior of Mars</a>, a region thought to harbor  <a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000JGR...10517563S' >formation clues</a> not only about Mars, but  <a href='ap070325.html'>Earth</a>.

The origin of the Martian moons is unknown, though, with a leading hypothesis holding that they are captured <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/asteroids/overview/'>asteroids</a>.  The larger moon, at 25-kilometers across, is <a href='ap030329.html'>Phobos</a>,  and is indeed seen to be a cratered, asteroid-like object in this <a href='https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/caption/vik_phobos_caption.html' >false-colored image</a> mosaic taken by the robotic  Viking 1 mission in 1978.   A <a href='https://news.brown.edu/articles/2018/11/phobos' >recent analysis</a> of the unusual long grooves seen on  <a href='ap151122.html'>Phobos</a> indicates that they may result from  boulders rolling away from the giant impact that created the crater on the upper left:  <a href='ap180505.html'>Stickney Crater</a>.   <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHDH7cKX_SA'>Phobos</a>  orbits so close to Mars - about 5,800 kilometers above the surface compared to 400,000 kilometers for <a href='ap020504.html'>our Moon</a> - that gravitational <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force'>tidal force</a>s are dragging it down.  The ultimate result will be for  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobos_(moon)#Predicted_destruction' >Phobos to break up</a> in orbit and then crash down  onto the Martian surface in about 50 million years.   Well before that -- tomorrow, in fact, if everything  goes according to plan -- NASA's robotic  <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-insight-landing-on-mars-milestones' >InSight lander will touch down</a> on Mars  and begin investigating its internal structure.
