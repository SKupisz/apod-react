A <a href='ap170301.html'>ring-of-fire eclipse</a> is an annular eclipse that occurs when <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/earths-moon/overview/'>the Moon</a> is far enough away on its elliptical orbit around <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/overview/'>the Earth</a> so that it appears too small, angularly, to cover <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/' >the entire Sun</a>. At the maximum of an <a href='https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/questions/question6.html' >annular eclipse</a>, the edges of the Sun can be seen all around the edges of the Moon, so that the Moon appears to be a dark spot that covers most -- but not all -- of the Sun. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_December_26,_2019' >This particular eclipse</a>, they knew, would peak <a href='ap191227.html'>soon after sunrise</a>.

The <a href='https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4744' >featured 23-second time-lapse video</a> shows four candidate locations for the touch, from which <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/x-marks-the-spot-nasa-selects-site-for-asteroid-sample-collection/'>NASA chose just one earlier this month</a>. NASA chose the Nightingale near Bennu's northern hemisphere as the primary touch-down spot because of its relative flatness, lack of <a href='ap190524.html'>boulders</a>, and apparent abundance of fine-grained sand. Location Osprey is the backup. NASA plans to <a href='ap181104.html'>return</a> soil samples from <a href='ap181213.html'>Bennu</a> to Earth in 2023 for a detailed analysis."

        "explanation": "<label class = 'explanation'>Explanation:</label> Can you find which day is the winter solstice? Each panel shows one day. With 360 movie panels, the sky over (almost) an entire year is shown in time lapse format <a href='http://www.murphlab.com/hsky/'>as recorded</a> by a video camera on the roof of the <a href='https://www.exploratorium.edu/'>Exploratorium</a> museum in <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hanE_bysWro'>San Francisco</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California'>California</a>. The camera recorded an image every 10 seconds from before <a href='ap120920.html'>sunrise</a> to after <a href='ap120522.html'>sunset</a> and from mid-2009 to mid-2010. A time stamp showing the local time of day is provided on the lower right. <a href='https://vimeo.com/32095756' >The videos</a> are arranged chronologically, with July 28 shown on the upper left, and January 1 located about half way down. In <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNln_me-XjI&f' >the videos</a>, darkness indicates night, blue depicts clear day, while gray portrays pervasive daytime cloud cover. Many videos show <a href='ap110516.html'>complex patterns of clouds moving</a> across the camera's wide field as that day progresses. The initial darkness in the middle depicts the delayed dawn and fewer daylight hours of winter. Although every day lasts 24 hours, <a href= 'http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130118171218AAbk8TE' >nighttime lasts longest</a> in the northern hemisphere in December and the surrounding winter months. Therefore, finding the panel with the longest night will locate the day of winter <a href='https://scijinks.jpl.nasa.gov/solstice/'>solstice</a> -- which happens to be today in the northern hemisphere. As the videos collectively end, <a href='ap120520.html'>sunset</a> and then <a href='ap110711.html'>darkness descend</a> first on the winter days just above the middle, and last on the mid-summer near the bottom."

It was made <a href='ap190627.html'>with solargraph</a> images from an ingenious array of 27 pinhole cameras. The first frame from the <a href='https://petapixel.com/2019/07/17/this-is-the-worlds-first-solargraphy-timelapse/'>Solarcan camera matrix</a> was recorded near December 21, 2018. The last frame in the series finished near June 21, 2019, the northern summer solstice. All 27 camera exposures were started at the same time, with a camera covered and removed from the array once a week. Viewed consecutively the pinhole camera pictures accumulate the traces of the Sun's daily path from winter (bottom) to summer (top) solstice. Traces of the Sun's path are reflected by the foreground Williestruther Loch, in the Scottish Borders.
