It is a digital composite of frames of the <a href='ap130801.html'>real Andromeda Galaxy</a>, also known as M31, rising over a real mountain.  Exposures tracking the galaxy and background stars have been digitally combined with separate exposures of the foreground terrain.  All background and foreground <a href='image/2003/Weisshorn_Andromeda_final.gif'>exposures were made back to back</a> with the same camera and telephoto lens on the same night from the same location.  In the 'Deepscape' combination they produce a stunning image that reveals a range of brightness and color that your eye can't quite see on its own.  Still, it does look like you could ride a cable car up this mountain and get off at the station right next to Andromeda.  But at 2.5 million light-years from Earth the big beautiful spiral galaxy really is a little out of reach as a destination.  Don't worry, though.  Just wait 5 billion years and the <a href='https://hubblesite.org/contents/news-releases/2012/news-2012-20.html'>Andromeda Galaxy will come to you</a>.  This Andromeda Station is better known as Weisshorn, the highest peak of the ski area in Arosa, Switzerland.  "

In modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun once is 365.24219 mean solar days.  So if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift from the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and eventually July (named for <a href= 'http://www.literaturepage.com/read/shakespeare_juliuscaesar.html'>Julius Caesar</a> himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter.  By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years,  the Julian calendar year would drift much less.  In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days  should not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400.  This <a href='http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html'>Gregorian Calendar</a> system is the one in wide use today.  <a href='ap171007.html'>Of course, tidal friction</a> in the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually lengthens the day by about 14 milliseconds per century.

The blue eclipsed moonlight originates as rays of sunlight pass through layers high in Earth's upper stratosphere, colored by ozone that scatters red light and transmits blue.

In a desert, there should be relatively few obscuring clouds and trees.

The color index is determined for each star by subtracting its brightness (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)'>in magnitudes</a>) measured through a red filter from its brightness measured with a blue filter (B-R).  Blue stars are hot and red stars are cool so that astronomical color index ranging from bluer to redder follows the relative stellar temperature scale from left (hot) to right (cool).  In M13's HR diagram, the stars clearly fall into distinct groups.  The broad swath extending diagonally from the bottom right is the cluster's main sequence.  A sharp turn toward the upper right hand corner follows the red giant branch while the blue giants are found grouped in the upper left.  Formed at the same time, at first M13's stars were all located along the main sequence by mass, lower mass stars at the lower right.  Over time higher mass stars have evolved off the main sequence into red, then blue giants <a href='ap140530.html'>and beyond</a>.  In fact, the position of the turn-off from the main sequence to the red giant branch indicates the cluster's age at about <a href='https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/ 2016ApJ...827...54D/abstract'>12 billion years</a>.

Specifically, as shown in the  <a href='http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Galleries/Featured-Images/image.php?gallery_id=2&image_id=590' >featured illustration</a>, it now appears that the larger lobe -- Ultima -- is more similar to a fluffy  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake'>pancake</a> than a sphere, while the smaller lobe -- Thule -- resembles a dented <a href= 'https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Juglans_regia_Echte_Walnussfrucht_2.jpg' >walnut</a>.  The remaining uncertainty in the outlines are shown by the dashed blue lines.   The new shape information indicates that gravity -- which  <a href='https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/planets-round/en/' >contracts more massive bodies into spheres</a> --  played perhaps less of a role in contouring the lobes of  <a href='https://www.sciencealert.com/we-ve-never-seen-something-like-this-orbiting-the-sun-ultima-thule-is-still-weird'>Ultima Thule</a> than previously thought.

The shower's radiant is rising just to the right of the Canary Island of Tenerife's Teide volcano, and just below the familiar stars of the Big Dipper on the northern sky.  A likely source of the dust stream that produces Quadrantid meteors was identified <a href='http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/leonidnews47.html'>in 2003 as an asteroid</a>.

With dark horizon above and sunset colors below, its segmented mirror inverts an image of the beautiful evening sky in this snapshot from the Roque del Los Muchachos Observatory on the Canary Island of La Palma.  The mirror segments cover a 23 meter diameter and are mounted in the open structure of the <a href='http://www.lst1.iac.es/'>Large Scale Telescope 1</a>, inaugurated as the first component of the <a href='https://www.cta-observatory.org/'>Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).</a>  Most ground-based telescopes are hindered by the atmosphere that blurs, scatters, and absorbs light.  But cherenkov telescopes are designed to detect very high energy <a href='https://science.nasa.gov/ems/12_gammarays'>gamma rays</a> and actually require the atmosphere to operate.  As the gamma rays impact the upper atmosphere they produce <a href='ap160820.html'>air showers</a> of high-energy particles.  A large, fast camera at the common focus images the brief flashes of optical light, called <a href='https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/toolbox/ gamma_detectors2.html'>Cherenkov light</a>, created by the air shower particles.  The flashes reveal the incoming gamma ray timing, direction, and energy.  Ultimately more than 100 Cherenkov telescopes are planned for the CTA at locations in both northern and southern hemispheres <a href='ap120202.html'>on planet Earth</a>.  "

As for most sundials the shadow cast by the central gnomon follows markers that show the solar time of day, along with solstices and equinoxes.  But markers on the radio sundial are also <a href='https://public.nrao.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ Bracewell-Sundial-Brochure_web.pdf'>laid out</a> according to local sidereal time.

Therefore, as <a href='ap950812.html'>Atlantis</a> blasted off, just after <a href='ap990726.html'>sunset</a>, its shadow projected away from the Sun toward the opposite horizon, where the <a href='ap010104.html'>Full Moon</a> happened to be.

The 500 million year old clash of two separate galaxies spans some 100 thousand light-years in <a href='http://spacetelescope.org/images/heic1811a/'>this sharp Hubble view</a>.  Of course when two galaxies collide, individual stars rarely do.

In this <a href='http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/'>galaxy clash</a>, the two original spiral galaxies had similar masses.  Their disks are no longer distinct and the two galactic nuclei are hidden by obscuring dust.  On the timescale of a few hundred million years the nuclei will likely also merge <a href='http://hubblesite.org/image/2318/news_release/2008-16'>as NGC 3256</a> becomes a single large elliptical galaxy.

   "explanation": "<label class = 'explanation'>Explanation:</label>  The striking X in this <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/main/ index.html'>lunarscape</a> is easily visible in binoculars or a small telescope, but not too many have seen it.  The catch is, this lunar <a href='image/1803/LunarXVAdamsson1024cmark.jpg'>X</a> is fleeting and only apparent in the hours before the Moon's <a href='http://home.hiwaay.net/~krcool/Astro/moon/ moonphase/'>first quarter phase</a>.  Along the shadow line between lunar day and night, the X illusion is produced by a configuration of craters seen here toward the left, <a href='http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/mapcatalog/usgs/ I822/'>Blanchinus, La Caille and Purbach</a>.  Near the Moon's first quarter phase, an <a  href='ap001209.html'>astronaut standing</a> close to the craters' position would see the slowly rising Sun very near the horizon.  Temporarily, crater walls would be in sunlight while crater floors would still be in darkness.  Seen from <a href='ap071227.html'>planet Earth</a>, contrasting sections of bright walls against the dark floors by chance look remarkably like an X.  This sharp image of the Lunar X was captured on February 22nd.  <a href='http://www.eyesonthesky.com/Moon/LunarX.aspx'>For extra credit</a>, sweep your gaze along the lunar terminator and you can also spot the Lunar <a href='image/1803/LunarXVAdamsson1024cmark.jpg'>V</a>.
