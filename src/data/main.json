Based on advice by astronomer <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosigenes_of_Alexandria'>Sosigenes of Alexandria</a>, the Julian calendar included one <a href='http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/astronomy/LeapYear.html'>leap day</a> every four years to account for the fact that an Earth year is slightly more than 365 days long.  In modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun once is 365.24219 mean solar days.  So if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift from the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and eventually July (named for <a href= 'http://www.literaturepage.com/read/shakespeare_juliuscaesar.html'>Julius Caesar</a> himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter.  By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years,  the Julian calendar year would drift much less.  In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days  should not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400.  This <a href='http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html'>Gregorian Calendar</a> system is the one in wide use today.  <a href='ap171007.html'>Of course, tidal friction</a> in the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually lengthens the day by about 14 milliseconds per century.  That means that <a href='https://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2012/02/29/the-physics-of-leap-day'>leap days like today will not be necessary ... about 4 million years from now</a>.  "

Three weeks ago, gravitational wave detectors in the USA and Europe -- the  <a href='https://www.ligo.org/science/faq.php'>LIGO</a> and  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_interferometer'>Virgo</a> detectors -- detected a burst of gravitational radiation that had the  <a href='ap160211.html'>oscillating pattern</a>  expected when a  <a href='https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes' >black hole</a> destroys a  <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/GLAST/science/neutron_stars.html' >neutron star</a>.   One object in  <a href='https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/25333.gcn3'>event S190814bv</a> was best fit with a mass greater than five times the mass of the Sun -- making it a good candidate for a black hole, while the other object appeared to have a mass less than three times the mass of the  <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/in-depth/'>Sun</a> --  making it a good candidate for a neutron star.  <a href='https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-virgo-gravitational-waves-first-black-hole-swallowing-neutron-star'>No similar event</a> had been detected with gravitational waves before.   Unfortunately, no light was seen from  <a href='https://anu.prezly.com/scientists-detect-a-black-hole-swallowing-a-neutron-star-like-pac-man'>this explosion</a>,  light that might have been triggered by the disrupting  <a href='ap170501.html'>neutron star</a>.  It is theoretically possible that the lower mass object was also a black hole, even though no clear example of a black hole with such a low mass is known.  The  <a href='https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/blackhole_meal.html' >featured video</a> was created to illustrate a previously suspected  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole'>black hole</a> - neutron star collision detected in light in 2005, specifically gamma-rays from the burst  <a href='http://www.mpe.mpg.de/~jcg/grb050724.html'>GRB 050724</a>.  The animated video starts with a foreground  neutron star orbiting a black hole surrounded by an  <a href='ap190820.html'>accretion disk</a>.  The black hole's gravity then shreds the neutron star, creating a jet as debris falls into the black hole.  <a href='https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190814bv/'>S190814bv</a>  will continue to be researched, with clues about the nature of the objects involved possibly coming from future detections of similar systems.
