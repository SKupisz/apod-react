They appeared even more incredible later, when digitally combined with an <a href='ap170522.html'>exposure of the night sky</a> -- taken by the same camera and from the same location -- an hour later. The two images were taken last August from the 220 Mile Canyon campsite on the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAfa8LKRVx8'>Colorado River</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado'>Colorado</a>, <a href='https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html'>USA</a>. The peaks glow red because they were lit by an <a href='ap980526.html'>usually red sunset</a>. Later, high above, the band of the <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/'>Milky Way Galaxy</a> angled dramatically down, filled with stars, nebula, and dark clouds of dust. To the Milky Way's left is the planet <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/saturn/overview/'>Saturn</a>, while to the right is the brighter <a href='ap200129.html'>Jupiter</a>. Although <a href='ap190908.html'>Jupiter</a> and <a href='ap170829.html'>Saturn</a> are now hard to see, <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/venus/in-depth/'>Venus</a> will be <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/whats-up-skywatching-tips-from-nasa/'>visible</a> and quite bright to the west in clear skies, just after sunset, for the next two months."

In the false-color view, bluish Zeta Oph, a star about 20 times more massive than the Sun, lies near the center of the frame, moving toward the left at 24 kilometers per <i>second</i>. Its strong stellar wind precedes it, compressing and heating the dusty <a href='http://espg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html'>interstellar material</a> and shaping the curved shock front. What set this star in motion? Zeta Oph was likely once a member of a <a href='ap970219.html'>binary star system</a>, its companion star was more massive and hence shorter lived. When the companion <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova'>exploded as a supernova</a> catastrophically losing mass, Zeta Oph was flung out of the system. About 460 light-years away, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Ophiuchi'>Zeta Oph</a> is 65,000 times more luminous than <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/'>the Sun</a> and would be one of the brighter stars in the sky if it weren't surrounded by obscuring <a href='ap030706.html'>dust</a>.
