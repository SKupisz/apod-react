In the false-color view, bluish Zeta Oph, a star about 20 times more massive than the Sun, lies near the center of the frame, moving toward the left at 24 kilometers per <i>second</i>. Its strong stellar wind precedes it, compressing and heating the dusty <a href='http://espg.sr.unh.edu/ism/what1.html'>interstellar material</a> and shaping the curved shock front. What set this star in motion? Zeta Oph was likely once a member of a <a href='ap970219.html'>binary star system</a>, its companion star was more massive and hence shorter lived. When the companion <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova'>exploded as a supernova</a> catastrophically losing mass, Zeta Oph was flung out of the system. About 460 light-years away, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta_Ophiuchi'>Zeta Oph</a> is 65,000 times more luminous than <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/'>the Sun</a> and would be one of the brighter stars in the sky if it weren't surrounded by obscuring <a href='ap030706.html'>dust</a>.
