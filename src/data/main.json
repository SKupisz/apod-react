Evidence for this has come from the <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/cassini/the-journey/the-spacecraft/' >robot Cassini spacecraft</a> that orbited  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn'>Saturn</a> from 2004 to 2017.    <a href='https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06254'>Pictured here</a>, a high resolution image of  <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/saturn-moons/enceladus/in-depth/' >Enceladus</a> is shown from a close flyby.

This very question,  <a href='http://adsbit.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1995PASP%2E%2E107%2E1133T' >among others</a>,  was debated by two leading astronomers 100 years ago today in what has become known as  <a href='https://apod.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate_1920.html'>astronomy's Great Debate</a>.   Many astronomers then believed that our  <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/285/the-milky-way-galaxy/' >Milky Way Galaxy</a> was the entire universe.   Many others, though, believed that our galaxy was just  <a href='ap020901.html'>one of many</a>.   In the  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)'>Great Debate</a>,  each argument was detailed, but no consensus was reached.   The answer came over three years later with the detected variation  of single spot in the  <a href='ap170303.html'>Andromeda Nebula</a>, as shown on the  <a href='https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/PAST/m31var' >original glass discovery plate digitally reproduced here</a>.

The best explanation, Hubble knew, was that this spot was the  <a href='https://hubblesite.org/contents/media/images/2011/15/2851-Image.html' >image of a variable star</a> that was very far away.  So M31 was really the  <a href='ap190909.html'>Andromeda <i> Galaxy </i></a> --  a galaxy possibly similar to our own.   The  <a href='https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/PAST/m31var'>featured image</a>  may not be pretty, but the variable spot on it  <a href='https://youtu.be/Fv4gWPurN9k?t=1582'>opened a door</a>  through which humanity gazed knowingly, for the first time, into a  <a href='ap200405.html'>surprisingly vast cosmos</a>.

This <i>Starry Night</i> was painted after the artist moved to Barbizon, about 30 kilometers southeast of any 19th century <a href='https://nightsky.jpl.nasa.gov/news-display.cfm?News_ID=745'>light pollution</a> from Paris.  Millet wrote to his brother at this time, 'If only you knew how beautiful the night is ... the calm and grandeur of it are so awesome that I find that I actually feel overwhelmed.'  Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh was an admirer of Millet's work, and later <a href='ap191023.html'>also painted</a> two dramatic <a href='ap100921.html'>starry nights</a>.  "

In modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun once is 365.24219 mean solar days.  So if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift from the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and eventually July (named for <a href= 'http://www.literaturepage.com/read/shakespeare_juliuscaesar.html'>Julius Caesar</a> himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter.  By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years,  the Julian calendar year would drift much less.  In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days  should not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400.  This <a href='http://galileo.rice.edu/chron/gregorian.html'>Gregorian Calendar</a> system is the one in wide use today.  <a href='ap171007.html'>Of course, tidal friction</a> in the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually lengthens the day by about 14 milliseconds per century.

Specifically, as shown in the  <a href='http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Galleries/Featured-Images/image.php?gallery_id=2&image_id=590' >featured illustration</a>, it now appears that the larger lobe -- Ultima -- is more similar to a fluffy  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancake'>pancake</a> than a sphere, while the smaller lobe -- Thule -- resembles a dented <a href= 'https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Juglans_regia_Echte_Walnussfrucht_2.jpg' >walnut</a>.  The remaining uncertainty in the outlines are shown by the dashed blue lines.

The 500 million year old clash of two separate galaxies spans some 100 thousand light-years in <a href='http://spacetelescope.org/images/heic1811a/'>this sharp Hubble view</a>.  Of course when two galaxies collide, individual stars rarely do.

In this <a href='http://burro.cwru.edu/JavaLab/GalCrashWeb/'>galaxy clash</a>, the two original spiral galaxies had similar masses.  Their disks are no longer distinct and the two galactic nuclei are hidden by obscuring dust.  On the timescale of a few hundred million years the nuclei will likely also merge <a href='http://hubblesite.org/image/2318/news_release/2008-16'>as NGC 3256</a> becomes a single large elliptical galaxy.

Commonly recorded in color by sensitive digital cameras, the airglow emission here is fiery in appearance.

The shower's radiant is at top left, high above the horizon near Castor <a href='http://stars.astro.illinois.edu/sow/pollux.html'>and Pollux</a> the twin stars of Gemini.  The radiant effect is due to perspective as the parallel meteor <a href='http://globalcitizenblog.com/wp-content/uploads/globalcitizen/ railroad_tracks414.jpg'>tracks appear</a> to converge in the distance.   Gemini's meteors enter Earth's atmosphere traveling at about 22 kilometers per second.  "

Pictured is an  <a href='http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1737a/'>artist's illustration</a> of what  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BBOumuamua'>'Oumuamua</a>  might look like up close.  'Oumuamua is also intriguing, however, because it has unexpected parallels to  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendezvous_with_Rama'>Rama</a>,  a famous fictional interstellar spaceship created by the late science fiction writer  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke'>Arthur C. Clarke</a>.  Like Rama, 'Oumuamua is  <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04927'>unusually elongated</a>,  should be made of strong material to avoid breaking apart, is  only passing through our Solar System,  and passed unusually close to the Sun for something gravitationally unbound.  Unlike a visiting spaceship, though, 'Oumuamua's  <a href='http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/info/press-releases/interstellar/'>trajectory</a>,  speed, <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09977'>color</a>, and even  <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11364'>probability of detection</a>  are consistent with it forming naturally around a  <a href='http://chandra.harvard.edu/xray_sources/normal_stars.html' >normal star</a> many millions of years ago,  being expelled after gravitationally encountering a  <a href='https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/'>normal planet</a>,  and subsequently orbiting in our Galaxy alone.  Even given  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbL1ZoAQgUU'>'Oumuamua</a>'s  likely conventional origin, perhaps  <a href='ap141208.html'>humanity can hold hope</a> that one day we will have the technology to engineer 'Oumuamua -- or another Solar System interloper -- into an interstellar Rama of our own.

It was discovered by 18th century astronomer <a href='https://www.astroleague.org/al/obsclubs/herschel/ fwhershs.html'>Sir William Herschel</a> as he used a telescope to explore the medicinal <a href='http://www.hawastsoc.org/deepsky/oph/index.html'>constellation Ophiucus</a>.  Herschel historically classified the round and planet-shaped nebula as a Planetary Nebula.  But <a href='http://www.messier.seds.org/planetar.html'>planetary nebulae</a> in general are not at all related to planets.  Instead they are gaseous shrouds created at the end of a sun-like star's life, the dying star's outer layers expanding into space while its core shrinks to become a white dwarf.  The transformed <a href='https://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/science/objects/ dwarfs2.html'>white dwarf star</a>, seen near the center, radiates strongly at ultraviolet wavelengths and powers the expanding nebula's glow.

Over 2,000 light-years away, the <a href='http://hubblesite.org/image/1251/category/112-hubble-heritage'>Little Ghost Nebula</a> offers a glimpse of the fate of our Sun, which could produce its own planetary nebula about 5 billion years from now.

Of course, that gravitational mass is dominated <a href='https://www.lsst.org/science/dark-matter'>by dark matter</a>.  The two large elliptical 'eye' galaxies represent the brightest members of their own galaxy groups which are merging.  Their relative collisional speed of nearly 1,350 kilometers/second heats gas to millions of degrees producing the X-ray glow shown in purple hues.  <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05501'>Curiouser</a> about galaxy group mergers?

According to the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle' >Holographic Principle</a>, the most information you can get from this image is about 3 x <a href='http://www.vendian.org/envelope/dir0/exponential_notation.html' >10<sup>65</sup></a> bits for a normal sized computer monitor.    The <a href='http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gr/public/holo/' >Holographic Principle</a>, yet unproven, states that there is a maximum amount of information content held by regions adjacent to any surface.    Therefore, <a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997PhRvD..55.5112B' >counter-intuitively</a>, the information content inside a room depends not on the volume of the room but on the area of the bounding walls.    The principle derives from the idea that the <a href='http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae281.cfm' >Planck length</a>, the length scale where <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics' >quantum mechanics</a> begins to dominate <a href='http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/General_relativity.html' >classical gravity</a>, is one side of an area that can hold only  <a href='ap170401.html'>about one</a> bit of information.    The limit was <a href='http://www.arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9310026' >first postulated</a> by physicist <a href='http://www.phys.uu.nl/~thooft/'>Gerard 't Hooft</a> in 1993.    It can arise from generalizations from seemingly <a href='http://www.arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0203101' >distant speculation</a> that the information held by a <a href='https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/black-holes' >black hole</a> is determined not by its enclosed volume but by the surface area of its <a href='http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Cyberia/NumRel/BlackHoleAnat.html' >event horizon</a>.    The term '<a href='http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2014/04/do-we-live-in-hologram-really.html' >holographic</a>' arises from a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography' >hologram</a> analogy where three-dimension images are created by projecting light through a flat screen.

In some locations, though, the effect was a rare type of partial  <a href='https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a012400/a012414/Eclipse_Geometry.png' >eclipse</a> called an  <a href='ap120519.html'>annular eclipse</a>.  There, since  <a href='http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/moon'>the Moon</a>  is too far from the Earth to block the entire Sun,  sunlight streamed around the edges of the Moon creating a  '<a href='ap090125.html'>ring of fire</a>'.  At some times, though, the effect was a rare type of  <a href='ap130509.html'>annular eclipse</a>.  Then, an edge of  <a href='ap130716.html'>the Moon</a> nearly aligned with an edge of the Sun,  allowing sunlight to stream through only low areas on the Moon.   Called a '<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baily%27s_beads'>Baily's bead</a>' or a 'diamond ring', this doubly rare effect was captured Sunday in the feature photograph from  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stjyguPcrSE'>Chubut</a>,  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina'>Argentina</a>, in  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America'>South America</a>.  This summer a  <a href='ap160821.html'>total</a>  <a href='ap170131.html'>solar</a>  <a href='https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2017Aug21Tgoogle.html' >eclipse</a> will swoop across  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America'>North America</a>.
